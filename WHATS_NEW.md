### Manage Your Projects All in One Place

**You asked for it, we built it!** Now you can track all your lighting projects right here in FOSSAPP.

### Numbers That Actually Make Sense

We fixed those annoying "0 products" bugs on the dashboard.

*Small fixes, big difference when you're trying to understand your data.*

### Now It's a Real App!

**You can install FOSSAPP just like any other app!**

- **On iPhone:** Share button → "Add to Home Screen"

*Use it like a native app - no more browser tabs!*
